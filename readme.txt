== Description ==

[wpStoreCart](http://wpstorecart.com/ "Wordpress eCommerce Plugin") wpStoreCart is a free, open source, and full featured e-commerce platform built atop of Wordpress.
It is easy to use, lightweight, heavily supported and constantly updated with new features.

[wpStoreCart](http://wpstorecart.com/ "Wordpress eCommerce Plugin") is an open source eCommerce solution for WordPress that allows you to quickly and easily sell your physical and digital downloads using your new or existing WordPress website. [wpStoreCart](http://wpstorecart.com/ "Wordpress eCommerce Plugin") was developed only after we had spent a few years being totally frustrated with other WordPress eCommerce plugins, which we found to be generally either unprofessional, hard to use, or would break everytime weâ€™d upgrade the plugin, not to mention most of them cost a lot money. So, we spent the last year developing [wpStoreCart](http://wpstorecart.com/ "Wordpress eCommerce Plugin") to be THE free, open source, easy to use, yet extremely powerful eCommerce plugin for WordPress that everyone has always dreamed of.  We're always looking for criticisms, suggestions, and tips on how we can make our plugin the best, so feel free to contact us on our [support forums](http://wpstorecart.com/forum/ "wpStoreCart Support Forums").  We also do custom Wordpress themes, plugins, modifications, consultation, business support, and more.
